# Vehicle Detection and Counting App
This project focuses on detecting and counting vehicles in images or videos using OpenCV and Haar Cascade. The purpose is to provide an efficient and accurate solution for vehicle detection and counting tasks.

## Features
- Vehicle detection: The application utilizes the power of OpenCV for image processing and Haar Cascade for object detection. With these tools, it can effectively identify    vehicles within a given image or video.

- Customized Haar Cascade classifier: In addition to pre-trained classifiers, the app allows you to create your own customized Haar Cascade classifier. This feature enables 
  you to train the model specifically for your use case and improve the accuracy of vehicle detection.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Usage
- Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/LaxmansAryan/Vehicle-Detection-App.git

- Navigate to the project directory:
  cd vehicle-detection-app

- Run the application:
  python app.py
Follow the instructions on the console to provide the input image or video.
